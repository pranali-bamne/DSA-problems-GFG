Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

Examples:-

Example 1:-
Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Example 2:-
Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1} 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array.

Solution:-

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(nums[i] == 1)
            {
                count++;
                maxCount = max(maxCount, count);
            }
            else
            {
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        return maxCount;
    }
};
